## Overview
An **AI-driven voice assistant** designed to enhance interactive learning experiences. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **speech recognition technologies** to understand and respond to user queries seamlessly.  

Key features:  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** – Converts AI responses into natural spoken language.  
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)** – Allows the assistant to understand user voice commands.  
- **Deep Learning Models** – Implemented using **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** for personalized responses.

---

## Features
- Real-time interactive voice-based learning.  
- Personalized responses based on user queries.  
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS).  
- Easy to extend with custom commands and knowledge bases.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI_based_voice_assistant.git && cd AI_based_voice_assistant`
2. Create and activate a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Run the assistant: `python src/main.py` Speak clearly, and the assistant will respond in real-time.
